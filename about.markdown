Hi, Welcome to my blog. If you came to this page,  is because you want to know more about the entity/person that is behind this blog, that probablly is not to much active, if that is the case, sorry about that. I will try to add more content soon. 

I am a Software Developer, from Argentina, currently living in Buenos Aires. So English is not my primary language so if I piss off with something writen please let me know and I will fix it. Have several years of experience working with several technologies, and do not want to list all of them here, so if you want to know more go to the next sites:

* [**Linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonafrank)
* [**GitHub**](https://github.com/jonafrank)
* [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/jonatanfrank) (you wont see much English here)

About me I enjoy what I do every day and the freedom that it gives to me to do what I love from wherever I am. 

Hope that this experiences be helpfull for you.
